\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class exists for the sole purpose of getting its destructor called when the module unloads. Before the module is done unloading, we need to delete the \hyperlink{classRobotBase}{RobotBase} derived singleton. This should delete the other remaining singletons that were registered. This should also stop all tasks that are using the \hyperlink{classTask}{Task} class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
RobotBase.cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}

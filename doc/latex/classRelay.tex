\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Class for \-Spike style relay outputs. \-Relays are intended to be connected to spikes or similar relays. \-The relay channels controls a pair of pins that are either both off, one on, the other on, or both on. \-This translates into two spike outputs at 0v, one at 12v and one at 0v, one at 0v and the other at 12v, or two spike outputs at 12\-V. \-This allows off, full forward, or full reverse control of motors without variable speed. \-It also allows the two channels (forward and reverse) to be used independently for something that does not care about voltage polatiry (like a solenoid).

\-Set the relay state.

\-Valid values depend on which directions of the relay are controlled by the object.

\-When set to k\-Both\-Directions, the relay can only be one of the three reasonable values, 0v-\/0v, 0v-\/12v, or 12v-\/0v.

\-When set to k\-Forward\-Only or k\-Reverse\-Only, you can specify the constant for the direction or you can simply specify k\-Off and k\-On. \-Using only k\-Off and k\-On is recommended.


\begin{DoxyParams}{\-Parameters}
{\em value} & \-The state to set the relay. \\

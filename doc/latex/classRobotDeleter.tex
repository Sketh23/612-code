\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-This class exists for the sole purpose of getting its destructor called when the module unloads. \-Before the module is done unloading, we need to delete the \hyperlink{classRobotBase}{\-Robot\-Base} derived singleton. \-This should delete the other remaining singletons that were registered. \-This should also stop all tasks that are using the \hyperlink{classTask}{\-Task} class. 

\-The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\-Robot\-Base.\-cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
